## Haplogroup Story

#### HTML
The index.html file contains a story viewer, implemented as an iframe, that imports a requested story, and inline CSS and jQuery which ensure the viewer fills the viewport. In the following

```
<iframe src="https://www.britainsdna.com/mydna/stories/view/{{HAPLOGROUP_ID}}"></iframe>

e.g.

<iframe src="https://www.britainsdna.com/mydna/stories/view/51efc0d376e0414a2000004f"></iframe>
```

There is a test Haplogroup id at the end of the url and you would replace this with the Haplogroup id for the customer result.

#### CSS + jQuery

Inline CSS and jQuery ensure the viewer occupies the whole of the viewport.
